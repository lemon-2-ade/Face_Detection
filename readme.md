# **Face Detection with Python**

This project demonstrates how to detect faces in an image using the `face_recognition` and `Pillow` (PIL) libraries in Python. It loads an image, detects all faces in the image, and draws rectangles around each detected face. The result is displayed and saved as a new image.

## Features
- Detects faces in a given image using `face_recognition`.
- Draws green rectangles around detected faces using `Pillow`.
- Saves the modified image with rectangles highlighting faces.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them via `pip`:

```bash
pip install face_recognition pillow
